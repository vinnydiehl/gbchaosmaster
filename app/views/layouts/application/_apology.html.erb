  | Hey there, fellow (developer|person that is curious about source code)! =D
  |
  | I see that you're viewing the HTML source of this webpage. And it will
  | probably make you barf. But please realize that I don't purposely write
  | ass-ugly code! It's just that this page is served dynamically, and I make
  | absolutely no attempt to make the end HTML product look nice, because that
  | would require me to sacrifice the beauty of the code that I have to work
  | with directly. Sorry!
  |
  | However, if you want to see what the code for this website actually looks
  | like, that's great, because it's completely open source! Check it out over
  | on GitHub, hopefully it'll increase your opinion of my code. ^_^
